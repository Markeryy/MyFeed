```

For VSCode

You can also go to lib/main.dart to run the file without debugging

If you want to test the app on a real device (android), run:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
Then install the apk found in build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk


## Challenges Met
One of the biggest challenges throughout the development of this application is the usage of firebase.
I had no idea how to interact with its server and user authentication. 
Luckily, there are a lot of online resources that I can use as a guide in order to understand the interaction
between the application and the server.

Another challenge that I met was the idea of implementing Futures and Streams. I had a hard time
understanding the specifics of how to use them. After watching a lot of tutorials about asynchronous
programming in Flutter, I managed to learn about them.


## Happy Paths
### 1.) Path/Testcase (register user) <br />
To reproduce:<br/>
- From the the login screen, go to sign up screen and create an account. <br/>

Result: <br />
- The registration works if the device has an internet connection and passes the new user authentication.
